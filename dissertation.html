<h1>Social Media, friend or foe?</h1> 
     
     <h3>Is social media affecting our mental health and the way we see ourselves more than we know?</h3>



<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Social media is any type of platform that can allow the user to partake, make and share in any form of social networking throughout the internet. </p>

<p>It as a whole is a platform that has taken the world by storm, and seems to be unstoppable. But my question is, <i>“is social media affecting our mental health and the way we see ourselves more than we know?”</i> Are we so engrossed in the way we portray ourselves and what we look like on social media that it has taken over what is most important. Which is of course, being happy within ourselves, our true human form.</p>

<p>From 2016 the number of children aged 8-11 years old with social media accounts has risen from 28% to 43% and, for children aged 12-13 years old has risen from 72% to 74%. These statistics are shocking to me, because myself personally at that age, I was out playing in the streets, not concerned about how many likes I was getting on a photo, or what was the latest picture editors I could download. It seems that in this day and age there is very little to no room for being a child anymore, children are being introduced to the world of social media so young resulting in a world revolving around the idea of perfection according to the internet.</p>


<blockquote>“One of the most challenging aspects of the digital body image is that these women with perfect figures that we’re aspiring to are women and girls all around us”.

    <p><cite>-“Why Social Media is Ruining Our Lives” by Katherine Ormerod</p></cite></blockquote>


<p>I think that one of the toughest ideas of social media is that the people that we follow, like, and aspire to be are meant to be <i>‘normal’</i> everyday people and that everyone can be just like them. When in actual fact the reality is, that most of the time their social media platform, being a blogger, is their full-time job, and that is what a lot of people do not realise. That these social media <i>‘stars’</i> have 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to achieve the ‘perfect’ body and get commissioned to advertised the products that they do, they do not afford them, it is in fact their job to promote them.</p>

<p>I will be researching whether or not there is a link between social media and mental illness, looking into both the positive and negative effects that social media can have on one's mental health in the twenty-first century. I want to look further into social media and the stigma surrounding it for young teens and adolescents, and the idea of <i>‘perfection’</i> that it portrays.</p>

 <blockquote>“Up to 57% of women say that they crop, filter or doctor their pictures” a quote again taken from Katherine Ormerod’s book.”</blockquote>

<p>Also I will be looking into the positive effect that it has had on our society being used as a vocal point for mental health awareness. As social media can be used as a space for the user to express themselves and their opinions, and to connect with other users making new friendships and relationships which some people may struggle to do face-to-face.</p>

<blockquote>“30% of 12-15 year-olds who use the internet have signed petitions or shared/ talked about the news on social media and engaged in civil participation.”</blockquote>

<p>As social media is such a big section of the internet I want to home in on and to delve deeper into the world of bloggers/vloggers on Instagram and YouTube. Researching into how being a subscriber to these channels has an effect on young/teens girls. I shall be taking one blogger who I feel is an inspiration to young women, and one that I feel focused too much on their digital body image and being the internets idea of perfection. Taking a look at their social media platforms, to see what the subscribers are viewing every day and whether they are putting their platform to good use in terms of helping and inspiring young women.<p>

<h2>Is the internet such a bad place?</h2>

<p>There are many positives that have come out of social media, one being <i>‘the body positivity movement’</i>. This is led by a group of women who are not fazed by the <i>‘one-size-fits-all’</i> image that social media puts upon the women of today. The women’s main objectives are to break the stigmas of the perfect body and, the airbrushed skin. Women like Kenzie Brenna, a body activist and her <b>#CelluliteSaturday</b> Instagram post’s. Teaching women the world over that cellulite is nothing to be ashamed of, everyone has it. To love their bodies, just the way they are.</p>

    <blockquote>"I think that you can use social media as a distraction, or you can use social media as a tool, a way to open up to a community you might not have access to in everyday life.”
        <p><cite>- Kenzie Brenna</p></cite> </blockquote>

<p>Social media is one of the greatest tools of the internet, if used in the correct way it can bring such a sense of positivity and community throughout the world. But that is just it, it is the way in which we chose to use our social media platforms that pave the way towards social media as a whole being a safer and more secure place.</p>
    
    <p>There are many other aspects of social media that are positive, one that I am going to touch upon is the rise that there has been in recent years when it comes to talking and speaking out about mental health. Mental health has been a grey area for so long, whispered and muttered under breaths. Social media has given people a platform to be able to come forward and talk openly about mental health, whether it be their own, a families members, or the subject in general. It has given the people a voice, to be able to come forward and speak up about the issue that is so close to many of our hearts.</p>

<blockquote>“Approximately 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year.
    In England, 1 in 6 people report experiencing a common mental health problem in any given week.”</blockquote>

    <p>Social media allows users to share their own personal experience of mental health issues, to help others that are suffering. It has given people a place to talk if they don’t want to talk to a doctor or their family, it has given a release. It has opened the doors for people to know that it is okay not to be okay, and that there is always going to be someone there to talk to. It is a support without even meaning to be.</p>
    
    <center><img src="images/brain.png" /></center>

    <blockquote>“Reports from both England and Wales suggest that approximately 1 in 8 adults with a mental health problem are currently receiving treatment. Medication is reported as the most common type of treatment for a mental health problem.”</blockquote>

<p>The blogger that I will be focusing this part of my essay on is Charly Cox. Charly is a blogger and a poet. The main reason I have chosen Charly is for the way in which she openly and honestly talks about her own personal struggles with mental health and how she has dealt with them. Charly has Bipolar. For those of you who don’t know Bipolar is a mood altering disorder, it changes the way in which someone thinks, sleeps and behaves. </p>

<p>In my opinion we need more bloggers like Charly on social media. I had looked at a lot of bloggers, changing my mind many times before I made this decision. I felt that Charly was the most relatable and down to earth blogger that I had come across. She has many sections within her page, one that particularly catch my eye was her poetry.</p>

    <blockquote><b><br>“Filters"</b>

<br>My eyes a little brighter
<br>My teeth a little whiter
<br>My skin a little clearer
<br>And my hair
<br>…accidentally a little greener
<br>The contrast of the exposure
<br>Is not one that’s clearer
<br>The definition of the portrait
<br>Is one of a heavyweight
<br>Photoshopper
<br>VSCO-er
<br>I feel pretty when I’m told I am
<br>I feel petty when it’s as cold as
<br>I’m a barefaced liar
<br>#NoFilter filter
<br>A scared-faced beauty in disguise
<br>A normal looking human being
<br>But my profile picture has you surprised
<br>As though it’s an image i’d been dreaming
<br>The resemblance is close
<br>My jawline is still mine
<br>And my nose is still my nose
<br>But would I still be of anyones desire
<br>If I wasn’t hidden behind Instagram’s required
<br>Mask?”


        <p><cite>-she must be mad, Charly Cox</p></cite></blockquote>

<p>I have included this poem by Charyl within my essay as feel it shows how young women within today's society can relate to her. Within her poem <i>“Filters” </i>she writes about how we disguise ourselves with filters and photoshop to make ourselves socially acceptable in the eyes of our social media friends. The vast majority of her poems are like this, writing about real life thought and feelings that would be going through the heads of those who use social media day in, day out.</p>

<p>Another section and another one of the main reasons I chose to focus on Charly was her <i>“People”</i> section. This is a page within her website that focuses on different people that she has interviewed and why she thinks they’re amazing. She promotes them and what they do for a living. It is something that I personally have never came across before, not in this sense before anyway. The interviews are rare and natural, as are the pictures that she uses. </p>
    
    <p>The subject of whether social media is affecting our mental health, is not a task that can be simplified.  There is no conclusion just an overall sense of good and bad, right and wrong and the answer is in the choices we make. it’s fair to say that the glass can be half empty or half full dependant on the personality of the person. I think the same applies to all social media aspects.  In life it’s <i>who</i>, we choose to be, its <i>what</i> we choose to look at, its <i>where</i> we want to go, it’s <i>when</i>we want to do it, and its ultimately <i>how</i> we apply the information. </p>

    <p>We need to also take responsibility of ourselves walk in our own shoes, make ourselves the best human we can be  we need to have tolerance compassion patience and be always kind. All of the factors who, what, where, when, and how influence and make us reason with ourselves.  We need to keep rationality at all costs and always apply common sense where we can.  Ultimately the decision is all ours to make.</p>

<h2>Is social media affecting our mental health?</h2>

<blockquote>“Social media has made us want to look like other people- but these people don’t even look like that”
    <p><cite>-Roxie Nafousi, influencer and mental health campaigner.</cite></p> </blockquote>

<p>I think that the most important thing about social media that the user forgets is that the vast majority of the pictures up loaded are edited, chopped and changed, they not the original. If we were to strip back all of our famous bloggers and celebrities of their photoshop and photo editors, would we aspire to be so like them? I’m not so sure. We as a culture and society have put so much emphasise and pressure on making ourselves look and be a certain way on social media, that it is making us unwell.</p>

<p>A study from 2014 US Glamour magazine stated that,<i> “64% of women said looking at pictures on social media sites like Facebook and Instagram made them have negative thoughts about their body.”</i></p> 

<p>My question is, <i>“how could women of today not feel a pressure to look a certain way”</i> when a more recent 2016 study showed that when researched reviewed the hashtag for “Fitspiration images” taken from Instagram for body type, activity and objectification. The results where one body type, toned and skinny. How have we come to this when in the 1950’s Marilyn Monroe was known as iconic for her size 14 beautifully curvy body. Where did it all go wrong?</p>

<p>If we are constantly reading these hashtags, and looking at these unrealistic photos, how are we to know to think any different. We start to believe that the pictures we see on social media are achievable, and we forget to take into consideration the photoshop and the editing that has went into these photos, before they are posted online.</p>

<blockquote>“If they listen to these messages, they come to believe two things: (a) I should look like that and if I did I would be happier, and (b) Practically anyone can look like this if they work hard enough and buy the right products and merchandise.”
    <p><cite>-Laura Choate, Swimming up stream: Parenting girls for resilience in a toxic culture.</p></cite> </blockquote>

<p>Women seem to be completely blind to the fact that the women they see in these photo’s are paid to look the way they look, and post the things that they post. It is their full-time job to be an internet blogger, they are given the luxurious merchandise to promote, they do not have to save up the money to buy it. They are given the opportunities to train, to achieve these <i>‘perfect’</i> bodies. They are not having to fit the gym and sessions in around a full time job, this is there full time job to look good for these photos, its what they are paid to do.</p>

<p>A prime example of this is Tammy Hembrow, a famous Australian, fitness, Instagrammer. She has taken the world by storm with her picture perfect body, whilst having two kids and maintaining this perfect body throughout both pregnancies . Making the three trimesters of pregnancy seem effortless, going to the gym and training throughout.</p>

<blockquote>“When it comes to striving for a six-pack, people are often only considering the now, and what they are seeing in the mirror in front of them. They are not thinking about fertility, bone density or gut health.”
    <p><cite>-Joan Murphy, Pips co-founder at Frame.</p></cite>
</blockquote>


<p>Women in today's society are aspiring to liken themselves to women like Tammy who has been training for the vast majority of her life, achieving what can only be described as, yes, amazing physique. But these women are not taking into consideration, that they have been training for years. It has not happened over night, and mostly importantly it is a full-time job for Tammy Hembrow to look the way she does. She is paid to work out, she is paid to promote the protein shakes, and the gym wear.</p>

<p>This is not realistic, this is not a stay at home mother, who is with her children 24 hours of the day, 7 days a week. This is a women who has a nanny, and who’s full-time job is to make her body look as <i>‘perfect’</i> as possible.</p>

<p>I am in no way trying to dilute this famous Instagrammers lifestyle as she has obviously worked very hard to create this profile I am simply pointing out that underneath the perception of perfect life she has a built in team of people who <i>'support'</i> her and, therefore create the persona that is not true. She does not do this on her own as her profile would try to reflect. This in itself would make any reader feel uncomfortable and not confident in their own abilities as the truth is she could not achieve so much if she lived a normal life without the team.</p>

<blockquote>“Social media has been described as being more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol”
    <p><cite>-Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the UK Royal Society of public health.</p></cite></blockquote>

<p>With social media being described in this way it is no surprise that a study in 2016 showed that Americans aged between 19-32 years old who were actively using social media were 2.2 times more likely to report concerns of eating disorders and body image concerns.</p>

<blockquote>“We live in a culture where eating disorders can thrive because of the messages we are exposed to” 
<p><cite>-says Clare Myske, CEO of the New York based National Eating Disorder Association. </p></cite></blockquote>

<p>This is a statement that I tend to agree with and can relate to greatly. We live in a generation where <i>‘fat shamming’</i> and <i>‘skinny slamming’</i> is seen as acceptable, and body dysmorphia is made out to be somewhat of a joke on social media. With women now feeling that so insecure that they have to make a joke out of their <i>‘knee baby faces’</i> or their <i>‘Nanny McPhee’</i> teeth, before someone else does.</p>

<p>In recent studies for Instagram it has been shown that the <i>‘like’</i> button is being hit over 4.2 BILLION times per day. We are part of a society where by if one person receives more likes than another, they must be better looking, or they must be more popular. We are obsessed with likes, we are obsessed with being liked and, we are obsessed with getting gratification from other via the <i>‘like’</i> button. This element of social media has taken away from artistic side to the sites like Instagram, and made them into a popularity game.</p>

<p>In 2014 Facebook was seen to have made an error when a study found that they had been using a  ‘newsfeed experiment’ to monitor how it could control its users emotions.</p>

<blockquote>“By manipulating the feeds of 689,003 unsuspecting users, the site assessed the impact of surfacing more negative or positive stories and hiding certain emotional words.”</blockquote>

<p>Whenever I read this statement I could not believe my eyes. The results from this study where that when one person portrayed a certain emotion, or claimed to feel a certain way that more would follow claiming they also felt this. We are blaming ourselves for the emotions that we feel as we scroll through our social media sites, but now my question is, are we really to blame? How are we as a society supposed to trust a site that claims security, when statements like this rear their head and the evidence is there to back it up. Maybe we are not the problem, maybe it is all a test of human strength and will power according to those who are apparently very much in control of us.</p>


<p>The summary is simple, most of us need to feel acceptance.  Is this right or is this wrong. Why can’t we live in a world where it’s simply good or bad, right or wrong? Is this too difficult. Do we really need the extras, why are we not happy in our own skin, with our own decisions. The answer I feel I don’t really know, does anyone? Is social media a contributory factor, of course it is. But it wasn’t always there, so I fear the answer is simple. We have what is known as choice. Thus to decide what is right for us. Life, and social media will always get in the way but, ultimately we have the freedom to decide. To decide whether or not to read that post, to mull over the comments, to mentally torture ourselves over the amount of likes that we get on a picture. Ultimately it’s our make up, our D.N.A. We make our own decisions.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h2>To conclude</h2>

<p>I would say that social media is always going to be there (for the foreseeable future anyway). It is the way in which we look at and perceive it, that will in turn change the way that we use it. If we find ourselves becoming affected by the things that we are seeing and reading on social media, we need to do something about it before it becomes a problem. There has been and always will be bad on social media, there is bad everywhere we look in life. It is what the user choses to do with those negatives that they find creeping onto their social media sites that really matters. They can choose to block/ report them, or they can read and fill their minds with the negatives. If you don’t like what you see, delete it. Although it may not seem it at times, it is just that easy and that is what we need to remember. Nothing that shows up on your social media profiles is permanent, you can always make it disappear.</p>

<p>There is a very positive side to social media and the way that it is used, this is the part that we need to focus on. The social media that is used to bring people together. The social media that is used to empower others. The social media that is used for body empowerment. The social media that is used to bring mental health to light, and the ways in which we can help the people closest to us that are struggling. This is the social media that we need to bring to light and that we need to focus on.</p>

<p>In terms of bloggers, and those that portray their <i>'perfect'</i> life, family, home etc, not one person on this planet is perfect. There is no getting away from them either, they are everywhere, but what we can do is become content within ourselves. We as a society need to come to terms with our own personal idea of perfect, and believe that it is enough. We need to stop looking for clarification from other users and become comfortable within our own skins. Whether this is achievable or not is a question that only we alone can answer.</p>
